In this paper, we describe the process of acquiring and preprocessing CIR data using UWB technology and introduce the artificial intelligence model trained on the collected data. We tested various AI models to identify the highest-performing one and utilized model fusion and consecutive CIRs to enhance not only the AI model but also the estimation method. This approach ultimately led to a more accurate identification of the number of people present. This system could offer a practical and accurate solution to the challenge of regulating the number of people in indoor spaces.

\subsection{Figures, Tables and Schemes}

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure~\ref{fig1}, Table~\ref{tab1}, etc.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{This is a figure. Schemes follow the same formatting. If there are multiple panels, they should be listed as: (\textbf{a}) Description of what is contained in the first panel. (\textbf{b}) Description of what is contained in the second panel. Figures should be placed in the main text near to the first time they are cited. A caption on a single line should be centered.\label{fig33}}

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
\begin{equation}
a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z
\end{equation}
\end{adjustwidth}

% Example of a page in landscape format (with table and table footnote).
%\startlandscape
%\begin{table}[H] %% Table in wide page
%\caption{This is a very wide table.\label{tab3}}
%	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{CCCC}

%		\noindent\footnotesize{\textsuperscript{1} This is a table footnote.}

%\end{table}

Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase ``of Theorem 1'' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}
